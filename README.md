# ZooMizer

ZooMizer is a coupling of the ZooMSS v2 (Heneghan et al. 2020) and Mizer (Scott et al. 2014) models. The coupling is achieved by running the ZooMSS zooplankton model as the resource spectrum for a Mizer fish model (e.g. the trait-based model from Mizer).

Required functions to run the ZooMizer model are found in `ZooMizerResourceFunctions.R`.
